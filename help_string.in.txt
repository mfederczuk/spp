usage: %s [-o <output_file>] [<file>...]
    Script Preprocessor - a general-purpose preprocessor program.

    Process each FILE given and output them all, concatenated, to stdout.
    If no FILEs are given, read from stdin instead.
    The first '-' argument seen will read from stdin, any subsequent '-' arguments are ignored.
    If an actual file named '-' needs to be read, use either an absolute path or './-'.

    Errors/warnings/notes are written to stderr.

    Options:
      -o, --output=<file>  Redirect output to FILE.
                           If it does not exist, it is created

      -t, --truncate  Truncate the output file (default) (only sensible when used with --output)
      -a, --append    Append to the output file instead of truncating (only sensible when used with --output)

      -h, --help     Display this summary and exit
      -V, --version  Display version and legal information and exit

    Exit Status:
